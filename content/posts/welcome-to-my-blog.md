# Welcome to My Blog! 🎉

Hi, I’m **Patrick** — and this is the start of my personal blog.  
I’ll use this space as a **working notebook**: a place to share things I’m building, problems I’ve solved, and ideas I’m exploring.

---

## 🔎 What to Expect

You’ll find posts about:

- 💻 **Technology & Programming** — small utilities, Go projects, and scripts  
- 🚀 **Cloud & DevOps** — Kubernetes, AWS, GitHub Actions, automation workflows  
- 🔧 **Infrastructure & Tools** — registries, scaling strategies, HPC cluster notes  
- 📚 **Learning in Public** — documenting experiments and mistakes along the way  
- 📝 **Occasional Notes** — thoughts on work, side projects, and productivity

---

## 🛠 How This Blog Is Built

- **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** — static site generator  
- **[PaperMod Theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)** — clean, minimal design  
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** — simple hosting with automated CI/CD
